## what is authdeck <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

<!-- # chi -->
> authdeck provides a two-way solution to verify humanity without losing anonymity and staying decentralized.

authdeck is a platform where you can prove your humanity by completing verification tracks which are mostly decentralized.
by doing this- you would increase your reputation score which other dapps would use to prove your humanity.

## verification methods <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
- captcha
- social verification
    - twitter
    - telegram
- Q&A to prove your humanity
- blockchain history
- vouching system

check explanation of each track in <u>[ðŸ”—](pages/tracks)</u>

## why authdeck? <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
the current verification in dapps is using KYC which is a complicated process and is not decentralized.

we use a simple process by calculating reputation based on multiple factors to prove your humanity without exposing yourself.

> this is a win-win situation for both users and dapps

- users don't need to upload personal documents, and wait for it to get verified
- dapps don't need to implement KYC- which is very complicated

by using authdeck, <br>

- users just need to complete the verification tracks once
- every dapp using authdeck can call our API to verify the user
