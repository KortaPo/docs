# Authdeck

## What is Authdeck <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

<!-- # chi -->
> Authdeck provides a two-way solution to verify humanity without losing anonymity and staying decentralized.

Authdeck is a platform where you can prove your humanity by completing verification tracks which are mostly decentralized.
By doing this - you would increase your reputation score which other dApps would use to prove your humanity.

## Verification Methods <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
- Captcha
- Social Verification
    - Twitter
    - Telegram (WIP)
- Q&A to prove your humanity (WIP)
- Blockchain History
- vouching system (WIP)

You can find more details about each track in <u>[tracks](pages/tracks)</u>

## Why Authdeck? <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
The current verification in dApps is using KYC which is a complicated process and is not decentralized.

We use a simple process by calculating reputation based on multiple factors to prove your humanity without exposing yourself.

> This is a win-win situation for both users and dApps

- Users don't need to upload personal documents, and wait for it to get verified
- dApps don't need to implement KYC - which is very complicated

by using authdeck, <br>

- Users just need to complete the verification tracks once
- Every dApp using Authdeck can call our API to verify the user
